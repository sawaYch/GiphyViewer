This is a simply react native giphy viewer application for interview code test purpose. Since I personally don't have Apple Developer Program subscription and MacBook, this app is only wired up and tested on Android platform.

Noted that Giphy API free tier has rate limit which its only provide 100 free call within 1 hours, and when limit exceed API will throw HTTP 429 TOO MANY REQUEST.

Github action deploy a release build which include a free tier Giphy API Key using Github secret.
