This is a simply react native giphy viewer application for interview code test purpose. Since I personally don't have Apple Developer Program subscription and MacBook, this app is only wired up and tested on Android platform.

## Get Started

```bash
# install deps
npm ci

# start metro
npm start -- --reset-cache

# install and test on android emulator
npm run android
```
